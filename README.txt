Abstract—.In the era of Cloud Computing and Machine Learning (ML), utilizing big data analysis to predict complex trends has become possible. Predicting stock market prices is one of those complex trends that is highly popular due to its large pool of available public data and significant reward if solved. Unfortunately, the stock market is an extremely complex and volatile system. In this paper, we will utilize Cloud Computing and a learning-based model to analyze 22 years of daily data to predict a company’s future stock prices. The proposed solution will utilize various techniques to pre-process the big dataset, stage the data to be used for our learning model, and train and test our model to predict price trends.

Keywords—Classification, Stock Market, PySpark.
